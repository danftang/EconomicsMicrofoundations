# Experiment 1: Sugr and spice wellbeing

In this world, two crops grow: sugar and spice. Spice takes twice as much labour to grow as sugar. An agent's wellbeing is a function of the amount of sugar and spice it consumes and the amount of labour it does. The maximum labour an agent can perform is 1 unit per month which is enough to mine 1 unit of sugar or 0.5 units of spice.

Given a society's wellbeing functions, there is an assignment of labour, sugar and spice to each individual that optimises collective wellbeing (the sum of agent wellbeings) while satisfying the constraint that the sum of assigned labour must equal the sum of labour necessary to grow the required amount of sugar and spice.

This experiment clarifies under what circumstances (if any) does a capitalist system perform as an optimiser of wellbeing (i.e. it optimises wellbeing for all wellbeing functions), and under what circumstances does it fail?

The model is as follows: there are Agents and Companies. Every agent either works for a company or is unemployed. Agents may also invest in a single fund which funds startup companies. Any agent can start a start-up and become employed by it.

Every company makes a product made of some proportion of sugar and spice, decided by the founder on incorporation. Each company grows its own resources of sugar and spice according to its "recipe" and its labour force.

An agent consumes so as to optimise its own wellbeing function within the constarints of its available budget.
